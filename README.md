## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hi everyone! I am Dawid - a student of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Cracow, Poland. On my profile you will be able to find projects related with Data Science, Machine Learning, Cryptography and any other mathematician applications. My main passion is mathematics, especially probability, statistics and broadly understood mathematician applications. Except that I am so fascinated by programming languages, artificial intelligence and everything about data. I connect my future career with Data Science and Statistics.
